ROWS AND COLUMNS

Declare Row with class="row"
Declare Column with class="col"
Remember the 12 Column System
3 Columns Where 1 Column == sum of other 2
<Div class="col-6">Test</Div>
<Div class="col-3">Test</Div>
<Div class="col-3">Test</Div>

Now modifiers when the size of the screen changes (There are standard screen modifiers in bootstrap)
For the below example the columns are equal in size for larger screen size but Column1 is twice as big as the other 2 at smaller screen size.
If you just use "col", the width will be auto generated 
<Div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-4">Test</Div>
<Div class="col-sm-3 col-lg-4">Test</Div>
<Div class="col-sm-3 col-lg-4">Test</Div>
-- Can read the above as the first column will be 4 columns at the large size and 6 columns at the small size.

can change the order of the column with order-#
